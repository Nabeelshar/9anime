9anime theme
9Anime Blogger Template is slick and clean, as well as a stunning UX/UI that makes visitors feel more comfortable and longer watching. Packed with standard features to create your dream anime streaming site.

This theme uses a unipost system which means all episodes are listed in one post. This is certainly different from the multi post system, which separates post series and episodes.

Creating a streaming template is not easy, the process is complicated, it requires funds, effort, and thought.

**How to make a post​**
Read carefully this section, because this section is the key to achieving high SEO rankings. Especially the Permalink, Title, Description
The entire post editing process is mandatory HTML View.

Permalink​
Permalink settings are in Post > Entry settings > Links > Special
Permalinks are permanent links, for example:

What I want to focus on is the URL after the date, this part: demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html. The tip is that the shorter the permalink the better but it still doesn't eliminate the meaning of the link. Blogger permalinks are created by entering the title abbreviation in the Special Permalink located on the right sidebar of the post settings.


How to create a permalink is to make an abbreviation of a long title such as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Entertainment District Arc
Because the title is too long, we only take the important part: Kimetsu Yaiba Entertainment Arc.
Note that sentences no and District are not included to shorten the title. Good permalinks:

Make permalinks that do not confuse search engines and users, easy to read and understand. Copy the title abbreviation then paste and publish
